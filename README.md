rmarkdown_converter.rb
======================
A Jekyll plugin that provides an Rmarkdown "converter," so you can write your posts and pages in RMarkdown and save them in your site's `_drafts` or `_posts` directory with the extension `Rmd` or `Rmarkdown`.

To install, simply save rmarkdown_converter.rb in your jekyll `_plugins` directory. You'll also need to install `rinruby`, probably [from RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/gems/rinruby): 

```
gem install rinruby
```

This code borrows heavily from the sample converter on the [Jekyll plugins documentation page](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/) and [this post by Simon Elliston Ball](http://www.simonellistonball.com/technology/embedding-rmarkdown-in-jekyll-blog/).

Now has [its own repository](https://github.com/atbradley/jekyllr).
